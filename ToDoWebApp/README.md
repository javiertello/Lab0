# WebApp with maintains a ToDo list

This project contains a little web application that shows the ToDo tasks stored in a file named ```todo_list.json```. The user can query for ToDos that fulfil some condition (a property contains some text).

Build the gradle project and run it with ```gradle jettyEclipseRun```.
So a [Jetty Server](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) starts and deploys WebApp at http://localhost:8080/ .
